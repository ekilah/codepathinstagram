### InstagramReader
An Android app for reading the popular public feeds on Instagram, built during a @codepath course on app development in Android. The purpose of the assignment was to practice designing UI elements in Android, and to get some practice with images, networking calls, and custom views.

#### Details
- How much time did this take?
  - This took me probably close to 20 hours of dev time with all the extra features. Most of that was spent on the UI layouts (including iterations)

  - [x] User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram 
  - [x] For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:

  - [x] Display each user profile image using a RoundedImageView (or equivalent)
  - [x] Display a default placeholder graphic for each image during loading
  - [x] Improve the user interface through styling and coloring (goal: immitate real Instragram UI colors/look)
